      <p>An exhibition has been opened commemorating acts of defiance and protest in Sheffield on the centenary of legislation which extended voting rights to women. </p>

      <p><i>Changing Lives: 200 Years of People and Protest in Sheffield</i> opened on Tuesday at Weston Park Museum and marked the passing of the Representation of the People Act. The law responded to the ongoing suffrage movement and the fight for women’s rights.</p>

      <p>The exhibition documents two centuries’ worth of challenges to the status quo in Sheffield, from Trump to trees and everything in between.</p>

      <p>Jean Crowmar, a former Sheffield University student and Sheffield city councillor, donated a sign and collection bucket to the exhibition which she had used on a stall in Fargate to help raise £25,000 in support of the miners’ strikes in Sheffield.</p>

      <p>“We used to collect money on the moor on Saturdays, my husband and I,” she said. </p>

      <p>“We used to count the money on our kitchen table and quite often we’d end up with wet pound notes from the buckets. We had to line them up on the radiator to dry out.”</p>

        Ms Crowmar was a Labour Party councillor in Sheffield for 19 years. In 1984, when miners across Yorkshire walked out over pit closures, Sheffield Central Labour Party committed themselves to supporting Cortonwood Colliery, where the strikes began.</p>
      <p>
        At its peak, the strikes involved 142,000 mineworkers and is considered to be one of the most bitter industrial disputes in British history. The site of the former colliery is now occupied by a shopping and leisure centre.</p>

      <p>
      “We still have contacts with the people from the mining community,” Ms Crowmar said. “We still keep in touch with some of them.” </p>

      <p>“The level of protest involvement shown in this exhibition demonstrates just how much it is a part of the nature of the city and of the industries in the area.” </p>
      <p>
      The exhibition commemorates both the historic legislation that gave women the right to vote and documents Sheffield’s central place in the miners’ strikes. The launch of the project coincided with the centenary anniversary of the first legislation that extended voting rights to include some women. The exhibition documents the rich history of societies’ struggle for gender equality.

      <h3>Here is a timeline of key developments in legislation on the issue:</h3>

      <p>
        The museum exhibit also explores Sheffield’s rich history of protest in a variety of contexts.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a statement, the exhibition’s organisers said: “Changing Lives: 200 Years of People and Protest in Sheffield will celebrate how people in our city have stood up for what they believe in over the past two centuries.”

        The exhibition includes historical objects such as the walking boots of Sheffield activist G.H.B. Ward, who campaigned for walkers’ rights and founded the Sheffield Clarion Ramblers, which is recognised as the first working class rambling club.
      </p>

      <p>
      The exhibition also explores contemporary social justice issues campaigned for by the likes of Black Lives Matter and Sheffield Pride and the power of humour, carnival and song deployed by such groups.
      </p>

      <p>
        Project curator, Louisa Briggs, said: “Sheffield has an incredible history of protest and activism. The passion people have shown, the commitment they’ve demonstrated, and the sacrifices they’ve often made for the causes that matter to them are a hugely important part of the city’s story.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The Weston Park Museum exhibition will be accompanied by another, Hope is Strong, which examines the role of art in raising important questions and challenging the status quo. It is set to open at the Millennium Gallery, on Arundel Gate, on Saturday 17 February.
      </p>

      <p><i>Changing Lives: 200 Years of People and Protest in Sheffield</i> will run from 6th February - 1st July.</p>
